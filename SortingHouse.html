                        <p>When Hogwarts was founded, students were assorted into different houses on the basis of their personalities and selected by the house founders
                            who were also the founder of Hogwarts.The founders, however, were unsure of how they would sort the students when they were dead. To solve this, 
                            Gryffindor took off his hat and all four of them enchanted it so that it could sort the students long after their deaths. 
                            It was, from then on, known as the Sorting Hat.
                        </p>
